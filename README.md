# SuperSlicer_Config_Clone
---
A tool to help manage multiple SuperSlicer / PrusaSlicer profiles without going through one by one to change parameters.

Some use cases include making the print speed parameters of all profiles the same but knowing the hassle of syncing the profiles or cloning support parameters across all profiles.

## Requirements
---
This script does not utilize many dependencies due to its simplicity. If you want to take advantage of colored interfaces to guide you, install `colorama` with the command:

```
python -m pip install colorama
```

Other than this, the script will work as is. Run with any version of Python as you wish.
